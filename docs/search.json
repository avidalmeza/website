I use tracking technologies to gather ecological insight about wildlife and support the conservation of our more-than-human relations. When I’m not coding away on my computer, you can find me outside on a trail, swimming in the ocean, or logging a wildlife sighting.\nStroll around my site to learn more about me and my work!"
