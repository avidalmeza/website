I use tracking technologies to gather ecological insight about wildlife and support the conservation of our more-than-human relations. Previously, I was a Dangermond Fellow at the National Audubon Society, in partnership with Esri, where I made maps to protect birds and the places they need. When I’m not coding away on my computer, you can find me outside on a trail, swimming in the ocean, or logging a wildlife sighting."
