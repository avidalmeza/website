## About

I'm an environmental data scientist from Lima, Perú, and a PhD student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. I use tracking technologies to gather ecological insight about wildlife and support the conservation of our more-than-human relations. Previously, I was a Dangermond Fellow at the National Audubon Society, in partnership with Esri, where I made maps to protect birds and the places they need. When I’m not coding away on my computer, you can find me outside on a trail, swimming in the ocean, or [logging a wildlife sighting](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=avidalmeza&verifiable=any){target="_blank"}.
