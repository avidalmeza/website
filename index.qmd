I'm a PhD student at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, advised by [Ruth Oliver](https://oliverlab.org){target="_blank"}. I use tracking technologies to gather ecological insight about wildlife and support the conservation of our more-than-human relations. When Iâ€™m not coding away on my computer, you can find me outside on a trail, swimming in the ocean, or [logging a wildlife sighting](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=avidalmeza&verifiable=any){target="_blank"}.
